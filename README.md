# Functional Programming Using C# 

This repository contains the code for the examples that I used for the talk that I gave for functional programming using C#.

## What Is Functional Programming ##

Functional Programming is style of writing programs based on Lambda Calculus â€“ a branch of mathematics older than computer science.
Functional programming treats Functions as first-class citizens, among other things a few characteristics of functions in this paradigm are:

* They map an input to an output. They should not have side effects and are idempotent.
* Can be passed as inputs to other functions, a function can return a function as its output.
* Functions can be partially applied to an input making it easier to express complex logic in smaller partially applied functions.

## Using The Code Examples ##

1. Basics: Introducing functional style as simple fun examples. Checkout the branch ```1-basics```.
2. Practical Examples: Some examples to arouse interest in functional way of writing code. Checkout the branch ```2-practical-usage```.
3. Functional Patterns Excercises: Some of the functional programming patterns, like Monads (MayBe monad), Partial Function Applications etc. Checkout the branch ```3-functional-patterns-excercises```
